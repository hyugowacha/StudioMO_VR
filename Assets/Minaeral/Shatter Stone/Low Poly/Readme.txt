//Shatter Stone: Low Poly// 2023 //

- Package setup for built-in render pipeline by default. 

- If using URP or HDRP make sure to use Unity's material upgrade tool.

- Node shatter and refined resource spawn controlled by script graphs, only object variables are used. 

- If scripts are not showing on the prefabs then check the Visual Scripting package is installed. 

- Extract LowPolyC#Scripts.unitypackage to access the C# versions.

- In demo level simply play scene and click on a node to trigger the shatter fx and resource spawn. 

- Meshes in demo level are for inspection only, these will not shatter - but the prefab versions will.
